# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Functions
	A repeatable program.  You make it generic at first and then add custom stuff each time you run it.
	* Parameters
	A parameter is the generic placeholder in a function.  It let's the function know to expect some data.  There can be more than one parameter used in a function.
	* Arguments
	Functions use arguments to add the custom stuff.  They hold the specific details and can be changed each time. There is usually an equal number of parameters and arguements.
	* `if` statements
	An `if` statement is a function that performs a series of true or false tests on an argument.  Is this thing true?  Then do this.  Is it not true? Then go to the next test. If it doesn't pass any test, then it will usually do a default action.


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Download (clone) this project folder from GitHub.


4. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


5. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


6. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
